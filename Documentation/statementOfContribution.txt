We originally split up the main parts of the code structure among the three of us: 
- Richard: Optimizing and fidelity calculation
- Kaushik: Recovery
- Lina: Encoding 

For the software implementation:

- Unitary functions: Richard and Lina
- 5- and 3-qubit VGQEC functions: Lina and Kaushik
- 5- and 3-qubit repetition functions: Lina 
- 5- and 3-qubit repetition and no protection noise parameters: Richard
- Optimization 5- and 3-qubit VGQEC for noise parameters: Richard
- Display plot for all methods of 5- and 3-qubits for noise parameters: Richard and Kaushik

- [5,1,3] recovery code (not used in final implementation) - Kaushik

We all collaborated to integrate all the implemented components so they functioned cohesively.

We worked together for the rest of the project including preparing the presentation, working on the report as well as the final submission.
All members contributed equally.
