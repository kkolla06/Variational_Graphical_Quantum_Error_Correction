We split up the main parts of the code structure among the three of us: 
- Richard: Optimizing and fidelity calculation
- Kaushik: Recovery
- Lina: Encoding 

We worked together for the rest of the project including preparing the presentation, working on the report as well as the final submission. All members contributed equally.
