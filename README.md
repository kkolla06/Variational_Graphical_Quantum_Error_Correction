# VGQEC

## Variational Graphical Quantum Error Correction Codes: Adjustable codes from topological insights

Our codebase is divided into 2 main python notebooks
1. CPEN400Q_3qubit_VGQEC_FINAL: graphs our implementation of 3-qubit VGQEC as well as the comparative strategies used - the no protection and repetition code circuits
2. CPEN400Q_5qubit_VGQEC_FINAL: graphs our implementation of 5-qubit VGQEC as well as the comparative strategies used - the no protection and repetition code circuits
3. [[5,1,3]]_Recovery_Code: shows our implemented [[5,1,3]] code circuit, however, this was not used in our final implementation


Running our code is very simple:
1. clone this github repo
2. run the required python notebook
